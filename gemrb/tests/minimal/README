This is a simple test case to see if gemrb works. It contains the minimal
dummy dataset required to run.

If you installed gemrb system-wide use fhs.cfg:
gemrb -c /usr/share/gemrb/minimal/fhs.cfg

Unless gemrb is installed elsewhere, it should run and print a bunch of
text and then automatically quit. You may briefly see a small window
appear. The last thing you should see in the console of a successful run is:
[SDLVideo]: Creating Extra Buffer...[OK]
[SDLVideo]: CreateDisplay...[OK]
[GUIScript]: Loading Script Start...[OK]


If it doesn't get that far and dies complaining about missing files, you
need to adjust the config to point to the right paths.

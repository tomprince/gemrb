Prototype: SetTAHistory(Win, Ctrl, KeepLines)

Metaclass Prototype: SetHistory(KeepLines)

Description: Sets up a textarea control for holding large amounts of text. If more than 'KeepLines' text scrolls up above, it will be discarded. This works best if TEXTAREA_AUTOSCROLL was set. The text is cut when new text is appended to the buffer, without TEXTAREA_AUTOSCROLL there is no automatic scrolling out of text. This function sets the TEXTAREA_HISTORY flag.

Parameters: Win, Ctrl - a window index/control index pair of the textarea 
            KeepLines - the number of lines to be kept

Return value: N/A

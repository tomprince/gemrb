Prototype: GemRB.SetWindowFrame(WindowIndex)

Metaclass Prototype: SetFrame()

Description: Sets Window to have a frame used to fill screen on higher
  resolutions. At present all windows having frames have the same one.

  To automatically move the windows from the edges and to let GemRB know
  how much space is there, the LoadWindowPack() function should be called
  with size parameters.

  Make sure to set the frame only for the window on the bottom, because the
  frames will erase the whole screen before drawing.

Parameters:
  WindowIndex   - the index returned by LoadWindow()

Return value: N/A

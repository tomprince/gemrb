Description: This table lists fonts. Only fonts listed here could be used as a font resource.

Columns: RESREF  - the .bam ResRef of the font
   NEED_PALETTE  - if the font has no own palette, set this to 1
     FIRST_CHAR  - usually 0, it contains the first printable character of the font.

Rows: <rowcount> - make sure the 9. font is a 'normal' font. Used for floating texts. (this is a hacked legacy feature, it may go away).

Example (BG2):
        RESREF          NEED_PALETTE    FIRST_CHAR
0       NORMAL          1               0

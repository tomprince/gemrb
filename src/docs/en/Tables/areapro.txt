Description: This table lists resource data for area projectiles. The original engine had these hardcoded in the .exe

Columns -
   RESOURCE1 - A BAM resref which is drawn in the entire area of effect.
   RESOURCE2 - A VVC (or BAM) resref which is drawn in the center of effect once.
   RESOURCE3 - An alternate animation (named recoil without better name)
   SOUND1    - Explosion sound (played on first explosion)
   SOUND2    - Area sound (played on subsequent explosions)
   FLAGS     - a bitfield which alters the way the resources are drawn

Values for the FLAGS bitfield -
   1     - RESOURCE1 is recoloured by the gradient set in the projectile
   2     - fills the entire area of effect randomly, otherwise it is a (spreading) circle
   4     - no spreading, the filler graphic is already at its destination, otherwise it starts from the center
   8     - RESOURCE2 is recoloured by the gradient set in the projectile
   0x10  - repopulate children that vanished
   0x20  - the child projectiles need gradient colouring
   0x40  - draw RESOURCE3 projectiles too (halves the number of children as well)
   0x80  - double the number of child projectiles
   0x100 - if none was affected by this projectile, apply a spell of same name on the caster

areapro.2da data could be completely incorporated into the projectile file, it is supplied
only for some BG2 spells that don't use the extended projectile format.

See projectile.txt for more information.

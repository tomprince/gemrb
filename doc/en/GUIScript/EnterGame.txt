Prototype: GemRB.EnterGame()

Description: Starts new game and enters it. It destructs all existing windows, and creates a GameControl window as the 0. window (the GameControl object will be its 0. control). You should already load a game using LoadGame(), otherwise the engine may terminate. The Game won't be entered until the execution of the current script ended, but a LoadGame() may precede EnterGame() in the same function. (SetNextScript too).

Parameters: N/A

Return value: N/A

Prototype: GemRB.SetToken(VariableName, Value)

Description: Set/Create a token to be replaced in StrRefs. QueryText() will use the actual value of the token when it encounters "<token>" substrings in a retrieved dialog.tlk entry. Some tokens are hardcoded and you can't affect QueryText() by setting them. Usage of those tokens should be avoided. The hardcoded token list:
FIGHTERTYPE  - always resolves to strref #10174
RACE         - always resolves to the race of the last speaker
GABBER       - always resolves to the longname of the last speaker
SIRMAAM      - strref #27473/#27475 depending on last speaker's gender
GIRLBOY      - strref #27477/#27476 depending on last speaker's gender
BROTHERSISTER- strref #27478/#27479 ...
LADYLORD     - strref #27481/#27480 ...
MALEFEMALE   - strref #27483/#27482 ...
HESHE        - strref #27485/#27484 ...
HISHER       - strref #27487/#27486 ...
HIMHER       - strref #27487/#27488 ...
MANWOMAN     - strref #27490/#27489 ...
PRO_*        - same as above with protagonist

Parameters:
 VariableName - the name of the variable must be shorter than 32 bytes
 Value        - string, the value of the token

Return value: N/A

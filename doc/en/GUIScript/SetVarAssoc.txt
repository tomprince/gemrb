Prototype: GemRB.SetVarAssoc(WindowIndex, ControlIndex, VariableName, LongValue)

Metaclass Prototype: SetVarAssoc(VariableName, LongValue)

Description: It associates a variable name and value with a control. The control uses this associated value differently, depending on the control. See more about this in "data_exchange".

Parameters:
WindowIndex, ControlIndex  - the control's reference
Variablename               - string, a Global Dictionary Name associated with the control
LongValue                  - numeric, a value associated with the control

Return value: N/A

Special: If the 'DialogChoose' variable was set to -1 or 0 during a dialog session, it will terminate (-1) or pick the first available option (0) from the dialog automatically. (0 is used for 'continue', -1 is used for 'end dialogue').

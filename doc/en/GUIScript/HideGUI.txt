Prototype: GemRB.HideGUI()

Description: Hides the game GUI (all windows except the GameControl window). It is also used before a major change is made on a GUI window. After the changes, an UnhideGUI() command should be issued too. The game GUI window references are stored in the following system variables:
MessageWindow - contains a TextArea for ingame messages/dialogue
OptionsWindow - a series of buttons for Inventory/Spellbook/Journal,etc
PortraitWindow - a series of portrait buttons
ActionsWindow - a series of buttons to Attack/Talk,etc
TopWindow - unused (might be removed later)
OtherWindow - this window usually covers the GameControl, it is used to display  maps, inventory, journal, etc.
FloatWindow - special window which floats on top of the GameControl
All these windows are associated with a position variable too, these are MessagePosition, OptionsPosition, etc.
The position value tells the engine the window's relative position to the GameControl GUI. The engine doesn't make any distinction between these windows based on their reference name. The differences come from the position value.
-1 - no position (floats over GameControl)
0  - left
1  - bottom
2  - right
3  - top
4  - bottom (cummulative)

Parameters: N/A

Return value: 1 on success?

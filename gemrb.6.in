.\"###################################################
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B GemRB
is an emulator for Infinity Engine-based games, fine RPGs like Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment.

.B GemRB
reimplements only the game engine. To actually play anything, you have to have
the data from the original game(s), installed or unpackaged where GemRB can find it.
See the
.I GamePath
and
.I CDn
settings in the engine configuration file below. A full install is recommended.

.\"###################################################
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c " FILE"
Use the specified configuration file
.IR FILE " instead"
of the default
.IR gemrb.cfg .  

.B Note:
You can also use the program's name as a mean to select the configuration file.
For example, if the program's name is 
.I torment 
instead of
.IR gemrb ,
the engine first seaches for 
.I torment.cfg 
and only if it's not found it searches for 
.IR gemrb.cfg .

To use this feature, just create a symbolic link
.I torment
pointing to the
.I gemrb
binary and then run
.IR torment
instead.

.\"###################################################
.SH Configuration File
.PD 0
A configuration file consists of pairs
.IR PARAMETER=VALUE ,
each on its own line. The case of PARAMETER is not significant, 
GameType is the same as GAMETYPE. If the same PARAMETER is defined 
more than once, only the last occurence is used.

Empty lines and lines starting with `#' (hash sign) are ignored.

.B Parameters:

.TP
.BR GameType =(bg1|bg2|iwd|iwd2|how|pst)
Type of the game. The value is a name of subdirectory in override/ 
and GUIScripts/ directories
with game type-specific files and scripts. It is at present also used
for various tweaks hardcoded in the GemRB engine.

.TP
.BR GameName =STRING
Arbitrary name of the game. It will be displayed in the window's title bar.

.TP
.BR GamePath =PATH
Path to the directory where the original game is installed. If you can't
install the game under MS Windows or with WINE, you can try to unpack the data files
with the
.I unshield
program found at 
.IR http://synce.sourceforge.net .

.TP
.BR CD1 =PATH
.TP
.BR CD2 =PATH
.TP
.BR CDn =...
Path to the data files for the game's particular CDs.

.\".TP
.\".BR INIConfig =FILE
.\"Name of the game's INI file, relative to 
.\".IR GamePath .
.\"E.g. for Baldur's Gate game it is baldur.ini.


.TP
.BR Width =INT
Game window width (in pixels).

.B WARNING:
This is not arbitrary but depends on the game data. For custom resolutions
the widescreen mod needs to be used.

.TP
.BR Height =INT
Game window height (in pixels).

.B WARNING:
This is not arbitrary but depends on the game data. For custom resolutions
the widescreen mod needs to be used.

.\"For other game types set it to
.\".IR 0 .

.TP
.BR TooltipDelay =INT
Delay (in miliseconds) before tooltips are displayed when the mouse is not moving.
A reasonable number for this option is e.g.
.IR 500 .

.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR ScriptDebugMode =(n)
This parameter is meant for developers. It is a combination of bit values

.IR 1
- count references,

.IR 2
- display cutscene warnings,

.IR 4
- display variable warnings,

.IR 8
- display action warnings,

.IR 16

.TP
.BR CaseSensitive =(0|1)
When 
this parameter is set to 
.IR 1 ,
the engine will try to find files regardless of their names' case at the cost
of a slight speed penalty. This is especially important when using
game files on CD-ROMs, where the files can't be renamed. Like 
many Windows programs, the original games use inconsistent mix
of lower/upper case letters for naming and referencing their files. 

Set this parameter to 
.I 1
on Unix-like systems.

.TP
.BR DelayPlugin =FILENAME
Named plugin will be loaded after other (nondelayed) plugins were loaded.
.IR FILENAME 
is a name without path, but with extension, for example
.IR libNullSound.so 
or
.IR libNullSound.dll .
You can use this parameter more than once.

.TP
.BR SkipPlugin =FILENAME
Named plugin will not be loaded.
.IR FILENAME 
is a name without path, but with extension, for example
.IR libNullSound.so 
or
.IR libNullSound.dll .
You can use this parameter more than once.

.TP
.BR AudioDriver =(openal|sdlaudio|none)
Use the specified plugin as the audio driver. The default is openal, while
.I none
will disable all audio.

.TP
.BR SaveAsOriginal =(0|1)
Set this parameter to
.IR 1 ,
if you want to keep the save game compatible with the original engine. It is enabled by default.

.TP
.BR CachePath =PATH
User-writable directory where the engine caches uncompressed and temporary
files.

.TP
.BR GemRBPath =PATH
Path to the GemRB installation. (To be obsoleted; preset at build time).

.TP
.BR GUIScriptsPath =PATH
Path to the directory with scripts controlling the game's GUI. 

.TP
.BR SavePath =PATH
Path to the directory with save games. Note that this directory has to
contain 
.I save/
and/or eventually
.I mpsave/
subdirectories and that only these subdirectories contain the actual
saved games.

.I SavePath
defaults to
.IR GamePath .

.TP
.BR GameOnCD =(0|1)
defaults to
.IR 0 .


.TP
.BR GameDataPath =PATH
Path to the original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's 
.IR data .


.TP
.BR GameOverridePath =PATH
Path to the original game's override dir, relative to GamePath.

.IR override .
Original games use this directory to place last-minute patches.
